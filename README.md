# Attendance Management System using Face Recognition üì∏‚úÖ

---

## Project Description  
This project, *Attendance Management System using Face Recognition*, leverages facial recognition technology to simplify attendance tracking. It captures and stores facial data, then compares it with data in the database to automatically mark attendance. This system reduces manual effort, enhancing efficiency for schools, colleges, and organizations.

### Key Features:  
- üè¢ **Real-time facial recognition** for attendance tracking.  
- üìÇ **Secure database storage** for attendance records.  
- üîí **Error handling** to ensure smooth operation.
